<h2>{% trans %}What is a comment?{% endtrans %}</h2>
<p>{% trans %}A comment is a piece of content, typically posted by a website visitor, which provides discussion or commentary on other content like forum topics, blog posts, and news articles. Comments are a type of content entity, and can have fields that store text, HTML markup, and other data. Comments are attached to other content entities via Comment fields. See <a href="{{ content_structure }}">Managing content structure</a> for more about content entities and fields.{% endtrans %}</p>
<h2>{% trans %}What is a comment type?{% endtrans %}</h2>
<p>{% trans %}Comments are divided into <em>comment types</em>, which are the entity sub-types for the comment entity type; each comment type has its own fields and form and display settings. For example, you might set up different comment types for commenting on different content entities on your web site.{% endtrans %}</p>
<h2>{% trans %}What is moderation?{% endtrans %}</h2>
<p>{% trans %}<em>Moderation</em> is a workflow where comments posted by some users on your site are verified before being published, to prevent spam and other bad behavior. The core software provides basic moderation functionality: you can configure permissions so that new comments posted by some user roles start as unpublished until a user with a different role reviews and publishes them. Contributed modules provide additional moderation and spam-reduction functionality, such as requiring untrusted users pass a CAPTCHA test before submitting comments and letting community members flag comments as possible spam. See <a href="{{ users }}">Managing user accounts and site visitors</a> for more about users, permissions, and roles.{% endtrans %}</p>
